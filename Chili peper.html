      High-quality Chilli, Hot Pepper seeds from a reputable source. Growing your own chili peppers means you can choose from a huge array of colours, shapes, flavours and levels of heat. 
        Growing your own chili peppers means you can choose from a huge array of colours, shapes, flavours and levels of heat â€“ a much wider range than you can buy in supermarkets.
         Chilies are easy to grow in pots in a greenhouse or, after starting off indoors, can be grown outdoors in a warm sunny spot.<br>

Germination of seeds: Place seeds into water for 24 hours, before placing them between moist paper towels. Chili seeds does not require light to germinate, but temperature is crucial.
 Keep seeds at room temperature while germinating, ideally use a heat pad to keep them at 25-27 degrees Celsius.<br>
Growing chili outdoors
When growing your own chili plants outdoors, they should be gradually acclimatized to outdoor conditions over a period of 7 to 10 days. Once acclimatized, move them into well-prepared beds of fertile, moist, well-drained soil.
<br>
Chilies thrive best in a warm climate and they can be grown in pots undercover in a warm greenhouse or polytunnel. You can also place your chili plants in a sheltered and sunny place.
<br>

If you are growing chilies in a greenhouse you can transplant them into grow bags (maximum 3 per grow bag depending on the size of the bag) or individually into 2-litre containers. Make sure that there is at least 50 cm distance between the pepper plants.
 When growing in 2-litre containers, it is beneficial to transplant the peppers to larger containers before they start flowering. Move the plants when most of the leaves are stretching towards the edge of the container.
<br>
Growing chili indoors
First, put the plants on a sunny windowsill, in a grow box, grow tent, under grow lights. Growing chilies with grow lights will extend the season and you can, of course, germinate your seeds any time during the year.
