		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Since thousands of years we, sri Lankans awarded huge popularity in the whole spice world.
As a result of that sri lanka was known as the Easter spice granary.
To reminiscence the proud history of our spice story we will carry on our name as the thaprobains.

</P>	

<P class="para_two">
Why aren’t we involving with external parties to make our spice mixtures?</P>	
<P class="para_three">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The major reason for above question is we have identified that most of the farmers are using harmful chemicals to increase their harvest without thinking about the health of the lives.
 so we were coming to a conclusion to not to take spices from external farmers.
 as a social service we are conducting awareness programs to inform how chemicals affect for the health specially using for spices and we are promoting organic farming with other farmers around the area.
As our aim of give the real taste of sri Lankan spices to the world we always want to deliver the best products consist of 100% organic spices to the international market we are the own growers, manufacturers of the thaprobain products.

	<div class="item">   <p class="para_two"> Why we had to rebuild sri Lankan spices as a brand?</p>
<p class="para_three">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At present most of the spice companies are only focused on the profit disregarding the quality of the spices.
	As a tactics most of the companies import cheap and low quality spices from different countries to mix them with sri Lankan spices.
	So it has lead the path for black mark in sri Lankan spice name.
	 Because of that matter many foreigners are afraid to buy sri Lankan spices.
	 As a true sri Lankan we have taken the first step to rebuild our true sri Lankan spicy taste to the world. </p>
