        <h4>
      How to cloves....<br>
      
      Cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) are an unopened flower bud from an Indonesian and Sri Lanka tree.
      
      They are used as a spice in food dishes, and also have medicinal and household uses.
      
      Every pantry should have fresh cloves and ground cloves on stand-by for various uses
      <p>
      Use cloves to flavor food. 
      
      Cloves have a strong, spicy flavor with a warm to hot taste. A very little goes a long way in food. Some examples of using cloves in food include:
      Relishes, chutneys, and pickles. Cloves make a spicy addition to many of these condiments.
      Add crushed or ground cloves to cakes and desserts requiring a warm, spicy flavor.
      Use cloves in Indian cuisine. Cloves are a popular addition to many curry dishes and to biryani.
      Use them with pumpkin and squash dishes; the cloves complement the flavors of these fruit vegetables well.
    </p>

      Health Benefits of Cloves
      
      Cloves have long been used in home remedies to treat for toothache pain.
      The Eugenio that provides the flavor of cloves is also a pain-reliever and can help relieve inflammation.
      Sexual Health
    </p>
  <p>
      Clove oil has been used traditionally to improve overall sexual function in men. 
      It is purported to increase testosterone levels and improve blood flow. 
      This is said to boost libido, improve the quality of erections, and prevent premature ejaculation. 
      There is limited evidence in humans to support the use of clove for sexual health.
